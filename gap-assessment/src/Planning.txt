Create a ReactJS Web application for the game of tic-tac-toe. The game
should be a playable web application. It should prompt users for their turn.
The game should determine the winner or if there is a tie. The game should
allow for rewinding of moves. The game should be able to be reset without
stopping the application. Styling should be used for a pleasing aesthetic.
The use of multiple small components is valued.
Additionally, you must:
- Write all code personally
- Test Drive all changes

- Utilize Jest or Mocha
- Utilize Enzyme for Component Testing
- Utilize public GitHub repo
- Commit after writing each test
- Commit after making each test pass
- Done correctly you should have around 100 commits


Notes - 
-install enzyme make sure it works,
-Uses classes in the squares, the sqaures wil be an array of buttons with an index
- useState to manage the gameHistory, MoveNumber, probably one for isXnext (set to true) and build conditional logic for the O, calculate winner helper function
- for the isXnext
    - const playerTurn = isNext ? "X" : "O";
-passing everything down with props since its not many levels



File Structure -
components 
    - Game - all logic done here, will have to pass things down to board and then square
    -Board - pretty simple, just make an array of squares while passing down props
    - squares - pass downed value and onClick method. similar to board we use ternerary to assign a marking with a class. it'll always have the square class though


Possible Test?
-render the game
-can make an X
-can make an O
-can see if theres a winner
-can see if theres a loser
